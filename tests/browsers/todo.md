# ✅ Test with playwright
- Created tests for Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers running in Docker containers
- All tests use explicit Playwright CDP connection to connect to Docker containers
- Tests have explicit setup and teardown rather than hidden fixtures

# ✅ Test persistent browser
- Added tests for browser session persistence with cookies and localStorage
- Implemented Chrome-specific persistent context test with the `channel="chrome"` option
- Each test uses explicit setup and teardown with proper resource cleanup

# ✅ Refactoring
- Moved from fixture-based approach to explicit helper functions
- Restructured to avoid "magic" and make test flow more visible
- Added clear logging to indicate test progress
- Updated documentation to reflect explicit approach

# Future Enhancements
- Add tests for browser performance metrics
- Add tests for browser extensions
- Add more comprehensive browser feature tests
